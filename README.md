# DARMA: Secure, Private DAG Blockchain with Smart Contracts
## ABOUT DARMA PROJECT
DARMA is decentralized DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) based blockchain with enhanced reliability, privacy, security, and usability. Consensus algorithm is PoW based on original cryptonight. DARMA is industry leading and the first blockchain to have bulletproofs, TLS encrypted Network.

### DARMA blockchain has the following salient features:
 - DAG Based: No orphan blocks, No soft-forks.
 - 15 Second Block time.
 - WASM smart contracts. 

### DARMA DAG
DARMA DAG implementation builds outs a main chain from the DAG network of blocks which refers to main blocks (100% reward) and side blocks (10% rewards). Side blocks contribute to chain PoW security and thus traditional 51% attacks are not possible on DARMA network. If DARMA network finds another block at the same height, instead of choosing one, DARMA include both blocks. Thus, rendering the 51% attack futile.
